Critics and fans often credit him for his musical versatility, with his music exploring <u>emo, trap, trap metal, nu metal, indie rock, lo-fi, hip hop, R&B, and punk rock</u>. He was considered to be a leading figure in the establishment of the <strong>emo rap and SoundCloud rap</strong> genres, which garnered mainstream attention during the mid-to-late 2010s.

<h1 align="center">His death</h1>
<p align="center">At 3:56 p.m EDT on June 18, 2018, Onfroy, upon leaving Riva Motorsports Motorcycle & Marine Superstore in Deerfield Beach, Florida, was blocked from exiting the parking lot by a black Dodge Journey SUV in a premeditated attack. Two armed men exited the SUV and approached the rapper while he was sitting in the driver's seat. A brief struggle occurred and the armed men reached inside Onfroy's vehicle, stole a small Louis Vuitton bag containing US$50,000 and shot Onfroy multiple times. The shooters fled the scene in their SUV. Onfroy was taken by paramedics to the nearby Broward Health North hospital in Deerfield Beach, where he was pronounced dead</p>
